h2. Overview

We connect aspiring music students with teachers.  Helping them check availability through a calendar and/or messaging system and connecting them through Google+ Hangouts to start the lesson. Students have the ability to pick the best teacher for them, by searching for instrument, availability, price and experience level. 

We plan to take a percentage of the teacher fee, which we'll integrate via a payment system on the site.
